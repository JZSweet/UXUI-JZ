            <p>GoalGetter is a centralized digital place to help middle school students keep track of an ongoing list of assignments and class deadlines during the pandemic. </p>
            <p>We believe that when given the correct tool, kids can easily practice the skill of organization. </p>

        </div>
        <div class='L1p'>
            <p>This project began because of a personal endeavor. <br>My friend Kristi told us over a chat about how challenging it is to manage her children's schoolwork during this pandemic, so we brainstormed an app idea to help with her situation. </p>
            <p>Kristi has six kids, each with unique needs and personalities. Some of them she can put on autopilot because they are straight-A students who are incredibly self-affection. Others may have a hard time staying focused or struggle to keep track
                of their hard copy school material. The circumstances worsened after the pandemic forced students to transition from in-person to remote learning without warning or practice. </p>

            <div style='max-width: 600PX; right: 40%; padding-top: 18%;'>
                <p>After seven interviews with both students and parents, my team and I found out that when homework is distributed digitally and by hard copy can cause students to turn in assignments late inadvertently, receive lower grades, and become
                    discouraged at school.</p>

            <h1>Empathy Map</h1>
        </div>
        <div class='L1p'>
            <p>We built an empathy map to articulate what we knew about our target user base on the interviews data. It helped us create a shared understanding of user needs and aid in decision making. </p>

            <p>Middle schoolers are a unique demographic. They straddled two worlds as they evolved from being young kids to young adults. Each individual makes this journey at a vastly different speed.
            </p>
            <p>We believe there is a huge opportunity to transform the way middle schoolers manage their schoolwork into a fun and delightful experience. Our successes will be measurable by improved grades and motivation. </p>

            <p>Parkour is a word Kristi's kids use when they talk about a shared passion. We thought the word Parkour - Athletic training to get from Point A to B in the most creative and efficient way possible, fit our core values. So we took inspertion
                from it and built out UI style tile and the logo.</p>

        <div class='L1p'>
            <p>We started the design process with digital wireframes. After first cycle of testing, we iteratied on our Lo-fidelity Wireframes. We prioritized three main changes:</p>
            <p>&#x220E;Add a way for users to take notes.</p>
            <p>&#x220E;Update terminology in the main navigation to help users understand.</p>
            <p>&#x220E;Add the “Goals” page to the scope of our project. </p>

            <p>&#x220E;Subjects Page - Add micro text to the class card icons so the purpose is clear. </p>
            <p>&#x220E;Calendar Page - Use icons/color to distinguish what assignments have been turned in, and include an inspirational quote at the top of the page.</p>
            <p>&#x220E;To-Do List Page - Minimize the colors to avoid visual confusion.</p>
            <p>&#x220E;Goals Page - Add a way to input goals and rewards.</p>
