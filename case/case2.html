            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>The official website of Festa Italiana Portland seeks a redesign to help lower the user bounce rate caused by the lack of secure payment and donated options.</p>
            <p>By redesigning the website, my team and I want to make an approachable and user-friendly experience </p>
            <p>for potential Festa supporters to learn about upcoming events, shop, and donate on the website without hesitation. </p>
            <p>We hope to make the online transaction experience more seamless, raise more money and keep current community members engaged. </p>

                <h1>User Interviews</h1>
                <p>We began the case by interviewing Festa supporters to understand their struggle when visiting the original Festa Italiana website. </p><br><br>
                <p>We learned that supporters who engage with non-profit organizations value a secure and transparent checkout process more than regeneration for their donations or gifts of gratitude.</p><br><br>
                <p>We also interviewed stakeholders for their input about the redesign. They wish to keep some of their existing unified styles. </p><br><br>
